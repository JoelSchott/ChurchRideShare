      <p class="w3-hide-small descTxt" >Growing up in a more rural college town, dependent 
        and accessible transportation was lacking in our community. This lack 
        of transit made it very difficult for people to get to church. It is 
        in our best hopes that !app! helps resolve this issue.</p>

        <p class="descTxt"><b>Ride Providers</b> are church members who will be 
        providing the means of transportation. You can become a Ride 
        Provider by creating an account and applying to your 
        corresponding church. Upon approval, you will be able to view 
        and accept ride requests.</p>

        <p class="descTxt"><b>Church Admins</b> are created by church staff. This
        allows the management of details on !app! such as service times, 
        locations, and website links. This information is available 
        to both Riders and Ride Providers. These Church Admins also manage
        who can and canâ€™t participate as Ride Providers for their 
        church.</p>
