        and accessible transportation was lacking in our community. This lack 
        of transit made it very difficult for people to get to church. It is 
        in our best hopes that !app! helps resolve this issue.</p>

    <p class="descTxt descTxt--bottom"><b>Ride Providers</b> are church members who will be 
    providing the means of transportation. You can become a Ride 
    Provider by creating an account and applying to your 
    corresponding church. Upon approval, you will be able to view 
    and accept ride requests.</p>

    <p class="descTxt"><b>Church Admins</b> are created by church staff. This
    allows the management of details on !app! such as service times, 
    locations, and website links. This information is available 
    to both Riders and Ride Providers. These Church Admins also manage
    who can and canâ€™t participate as Ride Providers for their 
    church.</p>
