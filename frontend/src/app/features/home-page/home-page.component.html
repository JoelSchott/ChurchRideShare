        <p class="d-none d-md-block descTxt" >Growing up in a more rural college town, dependent 
          and accessible transportation was lacking in our community. This lack 
          of transit made it very difficult for people to get to church. It is 
          in our best hopes that !app! helps resolve this issue.</p>

        <p class="descTxt descTxt--bottom"><b>Drivers</b> are church members who will be 
        providing the means of transportation. You can become a Driver 
        by creating an account and applying to your
